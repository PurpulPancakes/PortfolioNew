                <h3>Dragon Realm</h3>
                <p>
                    Dragon Realm is a Python application where I learned how to 
                    use a randomizer and have messages appear after a little pause. 
                    In this project I coded it so that you can choose 1 of 2 options, 
                    and the correct choice is always randomized each time. After 
                    you have choosen a path to go down, you are introduced to a 
                    simple cutscene I created with the use of pausing the messages, 
                    which gives the viewer enough time to read before the next line 
                    shows up, as well as adding some suspence as to what will happen next!

                <p>
                    Guess the Number is a simple program I made in Python in which 
                    a random number is generated from 1-100, and you have a few tries 
                    to guess the number correctly, however after each guess you will 
                    be informed on if the random number is higher or lower than your 
                    choice, which can be used to create a fun short game!

                <h3>Hangman</h3>
                <p>
                    Hangman is the original hangman game that you know today, but 
                    recreated in a python script! It displays the drawing of your 
                    answers remaining, a randomized word to guess, already guessed 
                    letters, updating the blanks for correct answers, and a replay 
                    system to play another game! What I find the best about this is 
                    the fact that it's very easy to add extra words to the game, as 
                    they are all in an array, and you can simply add or remove words 
                    to your hearts content!

                    a recreation of the tic tace toe game, but you face a computer 
                    algorithm who tries to get three in-a-row before you do! The 
                    gameplay works the best with the numpad on most keyboards, as 
                    it has a three by three grid very similar to tic tac toe, and 
                    it's very easy to see where you will place your piece without 
                    counting!

                <p>
                    Here is where I added a twist to my Tic Tac Toe Python game! 
                    This time it allows for 2 players (locally, litterally) to 
                    play together! Player 1 can choose X or O and can go first, 
                    in which instead of the computer taking it's turn, it allows 
                    for input again, where a second player can choose where to go! 
                    This was very exciting to get done, and it's fun to play with 
                    others!

                <p>
                    Ball Game is my first Unity game I made! It's a simple game where this shiny 
                    purple ball rolls around collecting these shiny golden cubes on this blue platform! 
                    It's a very simple game, but it's nice to have finally made something that can 
                    be considered a game in Unity! If you collect all of the golden cubes, you win! 
                    And this is further proven by the text "WINNER! :D" displaying on screen after 
                    you have collected them all.

                    This was a Unity project in which I was working on a top down shooter game to further 
                    understand how programming in Unity works! I made some silly edits here and there, such 
                    as replacing the space ship with a my first 3d model I made, BK, and he shoots down these 
                    meteors that are changed to look like meatballs! It was a lot of fun to make, the only 
                    thing it's missing is sound!

                    this character who has to shoot down hordes of stuffed animals for as long as possible, 
                    arcade style! I changed the textures to make the stuffed animals appear much more vibrant 
                    and made the character you play as look like a Wizard character from my Visual Basic games! 
                    Another silly edit I did was I added some sound effects like a pew sound effect, and changed 
                    the sounds of one of the enemies in the game

                    quite a bit of problems with this project, and we only had a 
                    week to create something. Even though I was only able to get a 
                    "game" where you walk around as a strangely floaty person named BK 
                    around a small field you can easily walk off of, I'm happy with the 
                    result, and would love to create bigger and better Unity projects 
                    in the future!

                    must make a choice, with only 1 path leading you to the

                    The Quest for the Chocolate Cake is the sequel to The Quest 
                    for the Grilled Cheese Sandwich! This game was created with 
                    Visual Basic instead, which allowed for the game to be much 
                    smoother than the original, and made routing quite easy! This 
                    time there are much options to select, but as you play as both 
                    the Wizard and the Warrior together, only 1 path is correct!

                    and avoiding scuttlebugs! I also added the inclusion of a second 
                    player, one uses WASD controls and the other uses arrow controls, 
                    your goal is to get the more meatballs before your opponent, as
