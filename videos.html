                <h3>My trip to japan from like a year ago (2020)</h3>
                <p>
                    This was a video I've uploaded and edited on April Fools day of 2021, 
                    the reason I choose this was because I wanted to put out a silly video 
                    on that silly day, and I just so happen to have quite a lot of footage 
                    from my trip to Japan from 2020 just before the lockdowns hit. I had a 
                    lot of fun timing the editing with the music for sure!

                <h3>The New Game #JFF #JFF48</h3>
                <p>
                    This was an project in which I had only 48 hours to plan, film, and edit 
                    a video for a film festival! I got my friends together to film this and 
                    had a ton of fun working on it! I'm surprised I was able to get this done 
                    on time, especially with the fact that it's hard for me to plan out films 
                    super fast like that!

                <p>
                    This was a video where I took a more relaxed approach to my usual style of 
                    videos and wanted to talk to my audience directly. I had fun with the editing 
                    however and I got to do some nice little edits of images and videos appearing 
                    in a nice manner when I talk about them!

                <h3>Army Men: Sarge's Heroes (N64) : My Childhood Game | PurpulPancakes</h3>
                <p>
                    In this video I review a game from my childhood, Army Men: Sarge's Heroes for 
                    the Nintendo 64! I had a lot of fun talking about this and wanting to share 
                    this game with the world and to those who might not have heard of it before. 
                    Some of my favorite edits are the smooth transition edits I made, as well as 
                    the parts where I appear in two places at the same time interacting with myself!

                <p>
                    This video I wanted to show the process of me making a Minecraft thumbnail 
                    for a popular Minecraft youtuber during this time, TommyInnit. They sadly 
                    did not use the thumbnail for the video, but I had a lot of fun creating 
                    this project! I was also impressed by the fact I was able to finish this 
                    video, as my computer is not that good at processing, so that was cool!

                <p>
                    In this video I wanted to talk about the Mario game I never played growing up 
                    as I never had a gamecube growing up! I had lots of fun with the "story" of the 
                    video, as I wanted to follow a plot point of the game and change it up a bit to 
                    fit the theme of my video!

                <h3>Wii Music : Because Learning Music is Too Hard | PurpulPancakes</h3>
                <p>
                    In this video I talk about the Wii game most people don't seem to like, 
                    Wii Music. I talked about this game because I actually had a lot of fun 
                    playing that game growing up and wanted more people to play it! I had lots 
                    of fun using and putting together greenscreen footage in this video! Fun 
                    fact, this video was originally going to be for a Video Essay project in 
                    my film class!

                <p>
                    In this video I got with my friends as went about recreating a scene from 
                    Star Wars, shot for shot. I was the primary cameraman, and I edited the 
                    whole thing together! It was very interesting making sure that the camera 
                    cuts matched perfectly with the camera cuts of the original source! This was 
                    originally going to be a submission for the Film Festival that year, which 
                    sadly got canceled.

                <p>
                    In this video we follow the movie trope of "The Hero's Journey"! It was a 
                    lot of fun to make a video that almost felt like a little mini-movie! I had 
                    a wonderful time putting together this story and making something to enjoy 
                    watching back with my friends! This was originally going to be a submission

                    time I can be shown surprising him with the creation and seeing what he 
                    thinks about it! It was a nice gift to put together for him, and it was 
                    lots of fun meeting someone who is a great inspiration to me!

                    the future first class as a way to introduce them to the filming technique 
                    of forced perspective, and when done right, you can make objects appear

                <p>
                    This video is one of my all time favorite videos I have put together! This 
                    was the first time I actually made a short film, and it was a lot of fun! 
                    I experienced scripting a large project, planning out cast and characters, 
                    planning out filming locations, filming with 2 cameras for more angles and 
                    better sound, etc. This was a ton of fun to create, and I would love to make 
                    more like this! This was going to be for a Film Festival project, but a 
                    different film was chosen to represent our class sadly.

                <p>
                    This video was a sped up video of my using Microsoft Paint as photoshop, 
                    how is that you may ask? Well I didn't own photoshop at the time, and I 
                    discovered the ability of the shift key, which allows for your current 
                    selection to be used as a brush! This video is very special to me, as it 
                    is (as of April 2021) one of my most viewed videos on my channel! I have 
                    no idea how it was recommended to so many people, it's not even that good 
                    of a video, but it makes me super happy nonetheless!

                    This video was one of the first slideshows I made! It's really funny 
                    to look back at, because of the fact that I barely actually focus on 
                    the convention it's self, and a vlog type of video would've done so much 
                    better here. Of course I didn't want to reveal my face at the time, 
                    so that makes some parts of the video a little funnier to watch.

                <p>
                    In this video I review a game from my childhood, Army Men: Sarge's Heroes for 
                    the Nintendo 64! I had a lot of fun talking about this and wanting to share 
                    this game with the world and to those who might not have heard of it before. 
                    Some of my favorite edits are the smooth transition edits I made, as well as 
                    the parts where I appear in two places at the same time interacting with myself!

                    In this video I wanted to talk about the Mario game I never played growing up 
                    as I never had a gamecube growing up! I had lots of fun with the "story" of the 
                    video, as I wanted to follow a plot point of the game and change it up a bit to 
                    fit the theme of my video!
