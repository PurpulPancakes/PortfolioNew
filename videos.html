                <h3>My trip to japan from like a year ago (2020)</h3>
                <p>
                    This was a video I've uploaded and edited on April Fools day of 2021, 
                    the reason I choose this was because I wanted to put out a silly video 
                    on that silly day, and I just so happen to have quite a lot of footage 
                    from my trip to Japan from 2020 just before the lockdowns hit. I had a 
                    lot of fun timing the editing with the music for sure!

                <p>
                    This was an project in which I had only 48 hours to plan, film, and edit 
                    a video for a film festival! I got my friends together to film this and 
                    had a ton of fun working on it! I'm surprised I was able to get this done 
                    on time, especially with the fact that it's hard for me to plan out films 
                    super fast like that!

                <p>
                    This was a video where I took a more relaxed approach to my usual style of 
                    videos and wanted to talk to my audience directly. I had fun with the editing 
                    however and I got to do some nice little edits of images and videos appearing 
                    in a nice manner when I talk about them!

                <p>
                    In this video I review a game from my childhood, Army Men: Sarge's Heroes for 
                    the Nintendo 64! I had a lot of fun talking about this and wanting to share 
                    this game with the world and to those who might not have heard of it before. 
                    Some of my favorite edits are the smooth transition edits I made, as well as 
                    the parts where I appear in two places at the same time interacting with myself!

                    This video I wanted to show the process of me making a Minecraft thumbnail 
                    for a popular Minecraft youtuber during this time, TommyInnit. They sadly 
                    did not use the thumbnail for the video, but I had a lot of fun creating 
                    this project! I was also impressed by the fact I was able to finish this 
                    video, as my computer is not that good at processing, so that was cool!

                    In this video I wanted to talk about the Mario game I never played growing up 
                    as I never had a gamecube growing up! I had lots of fun with the "story" of the 
                    video, as I wanted to follow a plot point of the game and change it up a bit to 
                    fit the theme of my video!

                <p>
                    In this video I talk about the Wii game most people don't seem to like, 
                    Wii Music. I talked about this game because I actually had a lot of fun 
                    playing that game growing up and wanted more people to play it! I had lots 
                    of fun using and putting together greenscreen footage in this video! Fun 
                    fact, this video was originally going to be for a Video Essay project in 
                    my film class!

                    In this video I got with my friends as went about recreating a scene from 
                    Star Wars, shot for shot. I was the primary cameraman, and I edited the 
                    whole thing together! It was very interesting making sure that the camera 
                    cuts matched perfectly with the camera cuts of the original source! This was 
                    originally going to be a submission for the Film Festival that year, which 
                    sadly got canceled.

                    In this video we follow the movie trope of "The Hero's Journey"! It was a 
                    lot of fun to make a video that almost felt like a little mini-movie! I had 
                    a wonderful time putting together this story and making something to enjoy 
                    watching back with my friends! This was originally going to be a submission

                    of forced perspective, and when done right, you can make objects appear

                    This video is one of my all time favorite videos I have put together! This 
                    was the first time I actually made a short film, and it was a lot of fun! 
                    I experienced scripting a large project, planning out cast and characters, 
                    planning out filming locations, filming with 2 cameras for more angles and 
                    better sound, etc. This was a ton of fun to create, and I would love to make 
                    more like this! This was going to be for a Film Festival project, but a 
                    different film was chosen to represent our class sadly.

                    more people to know about! I never finished Part 2 for some reason, probably

                    especially the fact that the first season is over 50 episodes long! But 
                    I wanted more people to hear about this anime, and I think that this was 
                    a pretty good way to do it!

                    first month of the console's release, so I decided to talk about the

                <h3>Let's check Miiverse: Mario Party 10</h3>
                <p>
                    In this video, I wanted to start a new series that only ended up being one 
                    video, in which I would check out various Miiverse communities and show how 
                    people are discussing games they enjoy! I had a lot of fun creating some silly 
                    edits with this, and the fact I edited this all in Movie Maker is incredible!

                <h3>MS Paint, the new Photoshop</h3>
                <p>
                    This video was a sped up video of my using Microsoft Paint as photoshop, 
                    how is that you may ask? Well I didn't own photoshop at the time, and I 
                    discovered the ability of the shift key, which allows for your current 
                    selection to be used as a brush! This video is very special to me, as it 
                    is (as of April 2021) one of my most viewed videos on my channel! I have 
                    no idea how it was recommended to so many people, it's not even that good 
                    of a video, but it makes me super happy nonetheless!

                    This was the very first video where I edited videos in time with music! 
                    This video was a recap of my content from the year of 2014, and it's 
                    amazing to see how much my content is changed over the years, like the

                    In this video I did the Ice Bucket Challenge with my friends as a way of 
                    raising awareness of ALS. This was lots of fun to do together with my friends,

                    This video was one of the first slideshows I made! It's really funny 
                    to look back at, because of the fact that I barely actually focus on 
                    the convention it's self, and a vlog type of video would've done so much 
                    better here. Of course I didn't want to reveal my face at the time, 
                    so that makes some parts of the video a little funnier to watch.

                <p>
                    This was a video I've uploaded and edited on April Fools day of 2021, 
                    the reason I choose this was because I wanted to put out a silly video 
                    on that silly day, and I just so happen to have quite a lot of footage 
                    from my trip to Japan from 2020 just before the lockdowns hit. I had a 
                    lot of fun timing the editing with the music for sure!

                <h3>I killed Dream in Minecraft</h3>
                <p>
                    This video was inspired by a Minecraft Thumbnail I made for fun! I 
                    wanted to test my skills to see how well of a professional Minecraft 
                    thumbnail I could make, and I ended up creating the thumnail for this 
                    video! I got my friends to help with it, one to film with a shader, 
                    and one to play the role as Dream! I had lots of fun matching the 
                    theme of the video up with Dream's content, and it was nice to use 
                    an audio clip that seemed like he was looking for me! (Side note, 
                    this is in the video game Minecraft, killing people is very illegal)

                    This was inspired by the trend going around where people would edit 
                    various people to be "the purple guy" from Five Nights at Freddy's. 
                    I thought I'd do something about it, because I realized that my 
                    character is colored purple, and is named "Purpul". So I knew I had 
                    to do something with this haha.

                    This video was purely for laughs, I had this picture of an ant that

                    the ant is all that is displayed and fit with very peaceful music. 
                    The best part about this video is the fact that I rendered it in 4k, 
                    because I thought that would be funny.

                    jokes, as well as making him appear to say "ants" repeatedly.

                    uploaded, as Youtube's copyright system blocked the video worldwide, so I had to 
                    get creative, I used a poorly stabilized version of the music video, flipped it, 
                    added a color filter, got a midi version of the song to play in the background, and 
                    bitcrushed the audio to a video that is no longer blocked worldwide. I guess my 
                    singing was just too good!

                    it appear as if he was mining the the wall like you would in the game Minecraft!

                    It was a really difficult game and died a lot, so I think it was funny to show 
                    how many times I failed in the game, some of which were a lot sadder than others!

                <h3>The Quest to Defeat Heat Man</h3>
                <p>
                    I made this video to showcase my absolute rage trying to defeat Heat Man's Stage 
                    in Megaman 2! His level is littered with all kinds of teleporting blocks, and you 
                    basically have to know exactly where to jump and when! And with one mess up meaning 
                    restarting from the beginning did not make things better. So I made this video as 
                    a way to show my thought process of trying to beat his stage, I say I captured that 
                    feeling perfectly!

                    thumbnail I could make, and I ended up creating the thumnail for this

                    and one to play the role as Dream! I had lots of fun matching the 
                    theme of the video up with Dream's content, and it was nice to use 
                    an audio clip that seemed like he was looking for me! (Side note, 
                    this is in the video game Minecraft, killing people is very illegal)

                    planning out filming locations, filming with 2 cameras for more angles and 
                    better sound, etc. This was a ton of fun to create, and I would love to make

                    different film was chosen to represent our class sadly.

                    I wanted more people to hear about this anime, and I think that this was

                    This video I wanted to talk about the NES Classic Edition, which 
                    was a way to play 30 NES Games in one, and in such a tiny console, 
                    it was adorable! I had to get it! As I only grew up with 1 NES game 
                    in the past, it was interesting finally playing more of the NES 
                    library after all this time! I also enjoy the glasses skit I did 
                    at the beginning of the video!

                <h3>PurpulPancakes: Club Penguin Game Day!</h3>
                <p>
                    In this video, I wanted to make the most fitting Christmas video yet! 
                    So I decided to play Club Penguin Game Day! As it contained a lot of 
                    snow! I say I did a solid job explaining the story of this game and it's 
                    game modes!

                <h3>PurpulPancakes: Top 10 Zelda Flash Games!</h3>
                <p>
                    This was the first Top 10 I did I my channel! In which I wanted to talk 
                    about some Legend of Zelda flash games as my way of participlating in 
                    Zelda Month, which is created by PeanutButterGamer, who is a huge inspiration 
                    to my content! I also wanted to talk about flash games, as I think they can 
                    always be very creative, and it was my first way of viewing, in a way, indie 
                    games!

                <h3>PurpulPancakes: Super Smash Bros. Brawl</h3>
                <p>
                    In this video, I wanted to talk about my first major Wii Game, and my favorite 
                    Smash title, Super Smash Bros. Brawl! Mainly it's story mode. I LOVED this story 
                    mode so much! And I really wanted to talk about why I loved it so much!
