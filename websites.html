                <h3>Pokemon Project - Wooperpedia</h3>
                <p>
                    This was the first website project I made! In which I worked with a group of people 
                    to create a Pokemon Wikipedia site! This was a lot of fun to create, and I think I 
                    did a great job learning how CSS works! It was my first time actually being creative 
                    with a site I was making, and I have defintely improved a lot over the years!

                    This was the second website I made with a group, and I was in charge of the CSS once 
                    again! I had fun using the hover animations as well as some perspective elements to 
                    give the website a bit of depth to it! I also had tons of fun creating the pictures 
                    for the website!

                <p>
                    This was another project I worked on with a group, this time we had to make to make a 
                    subscription based product website, as well as adding buttons that would change the 
                    color theme of the website! It was defintely a bit difficult to acomplish, as we didn't 
                    really know how we would create a website for a subscription based product, but I think 
                    we did well in the time given!

                <p>
                    This is one of my first big Javascript projects, in this one I created a full calculator! 
                    But not just any calculator, a gameboy calculator! I had lots of fun adding the CSS to the 
                    website to make it appear as an actual gameboy! My personal favorite edit was the power button 
                    that "turns on" the gameboy with CSS, as well as making the power button look like it's actually 
                    on!

                <p>
                    For this project, I was assigned to create my Christmas wishlist as a website! 
                    I was a bit worried, as I checked my Christmas list, and it was really long! 
                    Regardless, I went through with it anyway, going all out on the website making 
                    it look very nice to look at! As well as adding pictures to each object, all of 
                    which were sourced online, so It doesn't take too much to download, but with all 
                    the images, it still takes a while to load! But I' really happy with how this 
                    website looks!

                    With this project, I was tasked to make a website for my future entreprenuer 
                    studio Purpul Studios! I had lots of fun making it as if it were an actual website 
                    for myself! I would say it does go a little too much on the purple colors, and I 
                    clearly learned my lesson with this website, but I'm happy with it because I actually 
                    worked on it pretty fast!

                    This is a project I made for myself as a little challenge, also in hopes that I could 
                    potentially get a job at Youtooz in the future! The youtooz site looked fairly simple, 
                    and I wanted to show that if I could create the site from scratch, I could run the site 
                    nice and smoothly and make easy adjustments to it!

                    a friend and I had a little fun with this project, in which we 
                    changed the html of the site to create a very silly story featuring 
                    Laura Blake, which is now a running joke with us!

                    intended, as I turned this Realty site into a Horror themed website!

                    turn the website html into a Star Wars title crawl!

                    to me at the time, but it's important to note, as this was my first 
                    time learning a coding language that can be translated to other languages 
                    and help learn them quicker!
