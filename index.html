        <h2>About Me!</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! My name is Marcus Tinney, I love showcasing my creative side whenever possible! I like to see the art in 
            everything! From 2D to 3D art, picture to video editing, and even playing to making video games! My creative side 
            is what makes me who I am, because nothing makes me happier than making others happy with my work! <br><br>

            On social media I own the PurpulPancakes Youtube Channel, in which I am always experimenting with video ideas to 
            see what people are interested in. It's also a great way to showcase my editing skills, to which I am always 
            improving and trying new things! I have been running the channel for over 7 years now and I don't plan on stopping 
            anytime soon! <br><br>

            My main goal is to create content that hopefully brings just a little bit more happiness to the world!
