                <p>
                    Metal Gear has it's share of codec calls, in which the main character talks to someone 
                    for intel on the mission, and I wanted to create a pixelated version of that!

                    This is an animation I made for the Friday Night Funkin' Animation 
                    Jam! I don't really know how to make an animation really, but this 
                    was a lot of fun to do! I learned a lot about how to optimize my 
                    time, how to draw the characters to make them easier to animate, 
                    and I even got to sprinkle in a bit of my humor into it!

                    I LOVE THIS DESIGN! The bug like design was so much fun to do, especially all of the shiny elements!

                    This was my very first piece for Art Attack 2017! I had a lot of fun making it, 
                    I personally really liked adding the blur to mix the colors! This was my first 
                    revenge attack too!

                    Here I was tasked in my game design class to create a bedroom model within blender! This 
                    was very fun to make! Making all the small compontents, working with textures, and I even 
                    got to mess around with physics simulations for this project! The only thing that isn't made 
                    by me is the shiny rockruff pokemon, which I used to look like a plush doll at the table!

                    do colored eyes, but they have yet to do glowing eyes!

                    from my childhood back from the old days of watching youtube videos, but it's very inspirational to me, 
                    as it makes me feel that if I put my mind towards something, I can achieve whatever I want, and to never 
                    give up!

                    With merger photos, it appears as if things in the photo "merge" together to create something 
                    else! Such as with this image, in which it appears my friend has a plant sprouting out of his head!

                <p>
                    Here we went out with some classmates to take portrait photos, in which we take the photos vertically! 
                    We used a really high quality camera for these photos, and I'm really proud of how they came out! Such as 
                    the one above!

                <p>
                    With simplicity photos, photos are to be taken that doesn't have a whole lot going on, and I 
                    wanted to be really creative with mine! What I did was set up a scene as if there is an invisible man, 
                    to which I used fishing line and tape to make a "floating" hat and glasses!

                    This is an animation I made for the Friday Night Funkin' Animation 
                    Jam! I don't really know how to make an animation really, but this 
                    was a lot of fun to do! I learned a lot about how to optimize my 
                    time, how to draw the characters to make them easier to animate, 
                    and I even got to sprinkle in a bit of my humor into it!

                    This is an unfinished animation for a film fest that got canceled 
                    due to the pandemic of 2020. I was able to get the rough idea 
                    sketched out luckily so you can see what it was going to be! I 
                    created a simple to animate character for this animation and was 
                    heavily inspired by Aimkid's animations for this project, which 
                    is why I chose a song from Lemon Demon to animate what I thought 
                    an animated music video for it would've looked like!

                    animate my character in a way that put him into a video 
                    game!

                    This was my first ever Repaint of a game! I found a way 
                    to edit the textures of the game Undertale and change them 
                    to much more sillier changes! It's very basic edits, and it 
                    was my first time using an image editing software, so it's 
                    not perfect by any means, but it's amazing to see how much 
                    I have improved over the years!

                    to edit, and I eventually gave up after a while.
