                    This is an animation I made for the Friday Night Funkin' Animation 
                    Jam! I don't really know how to make an animation really, but this 
                    was a lot of fun to do! I learned a lot about how to optimize my 
                    time, how to draw the characters to make them easier to animate, 
                    and I even got to sprinkle in a bit of my humor into it!

                    This is an unfinished animation for a film fest that got canceled 
                    due to the pandemic of 2020. I was able to get the rough idea 
                    sketched out luckily so you can see what it was going to be! I 
                    created a simple to animate character for this animation and was 
                    heavily inspired by Aimkid's animations for this project, which 
                    is why I chose a song from Lemon Demon to animate what I thought 
                    an animated music video for it would've looked like!

                    This is a mod created for the game Friday Night Funkin' 
                    in which I replaced the character Pico with my character 
                    Purpul! It's a simple edit, but it was a lot of fun to 
                    animate my character in a way that put him into a video 
                    game!

                <p>
                    This was my first ever Repaint of a game! I found a way 
                    to edit the textures of the game Undertale and change them 
                    to much more sillier changes! It's very basic edits, and it 
                    was my first time using an image editing software, so it's 
                    not perfect by any means, but it's amazing to see how much 
                    I have improved over the years!

                    This was my second ever repaint! In which I edited every 
                    single texture for Super Mario 64! I was super proud of it 
                    as it took quite a long time to complete! However when 
                    loading it into the game, the textures sadly did not load 
                    properly, and it only appeared that 10% of the textures 
                    actually loaded, so 90% of the textures I've edited never 
                    appeared.

                    This is my third and perhaps final repaint! This time I 
                    was editing the textures for Mario Party 9! However I 
                    never ended up finishing it, as there were so many textures 
                    to edit, and I eventually gave up after a while.
