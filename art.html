                <p>
                    Metal Gear has it's share of codec calls, in which the main character talks to someone 
                    for intel on the mission, and I wanted to create a pixelated version of that!

                    This is an animation I made for the Friday Night Funkin' Animation 
                    Jam! I don't really know how to make an animation really, but this 
                    was a lot of fun to do! I learned a lot about how to optimize my 
                    time, how to draw the characters to make them easier to animate, 
                    and I even got to sprinkle in a bit of my humor into it!

                    I LOVE THIS DESIGN! The bug like design was so much fun to do, especially all of the shiny elements!

                    This was my very first piece for Art Attack 2017! I had a lot of fun making it, 
                    I personally really liked adding the blur to mix the colors! This was my first 
                    revenge attack too!

                    so I got with my friends and created some silly CD covers with them, and then we choose our favorite, and we

                    as heard in 009 Soundsystem "Dreamscape". This quote meant a lot to me, as not only was it a song 
                    from my childhood back from the old days of watching youtube videos, but it's very inspirational to me, 
                    as it makes me feel that if I put my mind towards something, I can achieve whatever I want, and to never 
                    give up!

                    giving a big thumbs up! This creates the flash of the camera being a bright light illuminating 
                    me, but not the background as it'f further away, creating the feeling that I can shine even when 
                    things may appear dark!

                    created a simple to animate character for this animation and was 
                    heavily inspired by Aimkid's animations for this project, which

                    was my first time using an image editing software, so it's 
                    not perfect by any means, but it's amazing to see how much

                    This is my third and perhaps final repaint! This time I 
                    was editing the textures for Mario Party 9! However I 
                    never ended up finishing it, as there were so many textures 
                    to edit, and I eventually gave up after a while.
